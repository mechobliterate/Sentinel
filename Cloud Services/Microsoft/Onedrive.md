## Overview

OneDrive is Microsoft's cloud storage service, tightly integrated with Windows and Microsoft 365. Files are scanned for malware, features, and (if enabled) personalization.

**Privacy Concerns:**
- Files scanned by Microsoft
- No end-to-end encryption
- Windows integration exposes usage
- Sharing defaults may be too permissive
- Diagnostic data collected
- Third-party apps may have access

---

## Quick Settings Checklist

- [ ] Review sharing permissions on all files
- [ ] Disable "Use OneDrive to fetch files" (remote access)
- [ ] Check "Shared with me" for unexpected files
- [ ] Review connected apps
- [ ] Disable automatic camera upload (mobile)
- [ ] Set diagnostic data to "Required only"
- [ ] Enable 2FA on Microsoft account

## Critical Settings

### 1. Sharing Settings

**Review all shared files:**
1. OneDrive.com > Shared
2. Check each item
3. Remove unnecessary sharing

**Sharing best practices:**
- Use "Specific people" not "Anyone with link"
- Use viewer permissions when possible
- Set expiration dates
- Regularly audit sharing

### 2. OneDrive Fetch

**Path:** OneDrive settings > PC Settings

❌ **Disable "Let me use OneDrive to fetch files"**

**Why:**
- Allows remote access to your PC through OneDrive
- Security and privacy risk
- Not necessary for cloud storage

### 3. Camera Upload (Mobile)

**Path:** OneDrive mobile app > Settings > Camera upload

❌ **Turn OFF**

**Why:**
- Automatically uploads all photos/videos
- Microsoft scans all images
- Location data included
- Use manual upload for control

### 4. Connected Apps

**Path:** Microsoft Account > Privacy > Apps and services

**Remove:**
- Apps you don't use
- Unknown third-party integrations
- Apps with file access

## What Microsoft Collects

**Always:**
- File metadata
- Sharing permissions
- Access patterns

## Privacy-Focused Alternatives

- **ProtonDrive** - E2E encrypted
- **Tresorit** - Swiss privacy
- **Sync.com** - Canadian, private

**Encryption layer (use with any cloud):**
- **Cryptomator** - Encrypt before upload
- **Boxcryptor** - Windows-friendly encryption

---

## Summary

1. **Review all shared files** - Audit regularly
2. **Disable OneDrive Fetch** - Remove remote PC access
3. **Turn off camera upload** - Manual control
4. **Check connected apps** - Remove unnecessary
5. **Consider encryption** - Cryptomator for sensitive files
