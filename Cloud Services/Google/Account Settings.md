## Critical Privacy Settings

### 1. Web & App Activity (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Path:** Data & privacy > Web & App Activity

**What it collects:**
- Everything you search
- Every website you visit (if using Chrome)
- Every app you use
- Voice commands
- Location from searches

**Recommendation:** ❌ **Pause** or set auto-delete (3 months)

**Impact:**
- Less personalized services
- Reduced ad targeting
- Better privacy

**Also uncheck:**
- "Include Chrome history and activity"
- "Include audio recordings"

### 2. Location History

**Path:** Data & privacy > Location History

❌ **Pause completely**

**What it tracks:**
- Everywhere you go with your phone
- Creates detailed timeline
- Used for ads, traffic estimates, recommendations

**This is one of the most invasive tracking features.**

### 3. YouTube History

**Path:** Data & privacy > YouTube History

❌ **Pause** or auto-delete (3 months)

- Watch history
- Search history

Both used for recommendations and ads.

### 4. Ad Personalization

**Path:** Data & privacy > Ad settings

❌ **Turn OFF "Ad Personalization"**

**Critical setting:**
- You'll still see ads
- They just won't be targeted based on your data
- Major privacy improvement

### 5. Activity Controls Summary

| Setting | Recommendation | Impact |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Web & App Activity | Pause or auto-delete (3mo) | High privacy gain |
| Location History | Pause | Extremely high privacy gain |
| YouTube History | Pause or auto-delete (3mo) | Moderate privacy gain |
