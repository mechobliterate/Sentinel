## FAQs

### General Questions

**Q: How often should I review my privacy settings?**  
A: We recommend reviewing your privacy settings quarterly or whenever an app releases a major update. Many apps introduce new features that come with additional data collection by default.

**Q: Will these settings break app functionality?**  
A: Most settings in our guides maintain full functionality while maximizing privacy. When a setting may reduce features, we clearly note this with warnings and explain the trade-offs.

**Q: Can I undo these changes?**  
A: Yes! All settings can be reversed. We recommend taking screenshots of your original settings before making changes, or reviewing each guide carefully to understand what you're changing.

**Q: Do these settings guarantee complete privacy?**  
A: No settings can guarantee complete privacy. These guides minimize data collection and sharing, but apps may still collect certain data required for basic functionality. We're transparent about what data is still collected in each guide.

**Q: Are these settings legal?**  
A: Yes. All settings documented here use official privacy controls provided by the applications themselves. You have the legal right to configure your privacy settings.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Will these settings affect app performance?**  
A: Generally no. Most privacy settings don't impact performance. In rare cases where they might (like disabling background app refresh), we note this in the guide.

**Q: What if a setting isn't available on my device?**  
A: Settings availability can vary by region, device, or app version. If you don't see a setting mentioned in our guides, it may not be available in your location or version. Check for app updates or regional restrictions.

**Q: Can I export my data before changing settings?**  
A: Most major platforms offer data export tools. We include links to data export options in each guide where available.

### Contributing Questions

**Q: How can I suggest a new app to be documented?**  
A: Open an issue on GitHub with the "app request" label, or see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

**Q: I found outdated information. How do I report it?**  
A: Please open an issue or submit a pull request with the updated information. Include the app version number and date you verified the settings.

**Q: Can I translate guides to other languages?**  
A: Yes! We welcome translations. Please see our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for translation guidelines.
